### About Me
<p1>
  I'm a sophomore in Winthrop house that's currently planning on studying Computer
  Science with a secondary in Neuroscience. I'm interested in pursuing a career 
  in computational chemistry after graduation. I originally was not thinking about
  doing computational neuroscience at all until I got bored over the summer and 
  looked through the course catalog and found some interesting classes and though hmmmmm
  maybe I can do that.

  My favorite food by far is sushi, but there's just some foods that I will absolutely
  not touch. ANYTHING to do with honey, cocunut, pineapple, cantalope, or otherwise adjacent
  I just cannot stomach.
