#### Week 2: Press Fit 

<p1>
  I wasnted to make a press fit kit out of one of my favorite shapes, which is a pentagon. 
  This proved to be harder than inititally anticipated as originally I didn't account for the 
  thickness of the material I was using

  The image above was my first attempt at making the pentagon shape. I created it using Fusion360, but 
  when I first created it I made it such that the slots were 2mm in length even though my material thickness was around 
  4mm. Thus pentagons that I originally made did not slot together that well at all and I had to adjust the length 
  of the slots made.

  I then went on to change the length to 3.9mm to account for the extra bit of material that the laser cutter takes
  off with the kerf it has
